Encryption

Program that asks the user the encryption key and checks that the input can
be used as a encryption key. There are three limits to the key: the string
must be 26 chars long, it can only contain lowercase letters 'a' - 'z' and
it must contain every letter from 'a' - 'z'. If some of these isn't correct,
program prints an error and the program ends to a return value EXIT_FAILURE.

If the key is correct, program asks user to give a message to encrypt. The
text to be encrypted must contain lowercase letter from 'a' - 'z' otherwise
an error will occur. After the encryption is done, the program will end to a
return value EXIT_SUCCESS.
